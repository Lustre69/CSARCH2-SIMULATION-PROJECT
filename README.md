## Test Case 1: Sequential
The first test case is a sequence of numbers up to n(number of memory blocks) repeated 2 times.
The first half of the sequence are all cache misses since they are all unique numbers from 0 to n while the second half are all cache hits since they are now all present in the cache memory. Furthermore, the expected output would have half of the sequence having a cache miss and the other half having cache hits.
